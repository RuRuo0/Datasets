During extracurricular activities in the afternoon, he measured the shadow length of a bamboo pole with a length of N_0 to be N_1. But when he immediately measured the height of the tree, he found that not all the shadow of the tree fell on the ground, and some of the shadow fell on the wall of the teaching building (pictured). He first measured the height of the tree shadow on the wall as N_2, and then measured the shadow length on the ground as N_3. Please help him to calculate which of the following numbers is closest to the height of the tree ()."}
